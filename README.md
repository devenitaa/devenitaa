## Hi there üëã

Hello! My name is Venita, and I am currently living in Yogyakarta. I am a student at Universitas Gadjah Mada, majoring in Geophysics. I have always been passionate about learning and challenging myself to grow both academically and personally.

People often describe me as a hardworking, creative, and responsible person. I enjoy collaborating with others but I can also work independently when needed. Although I sometimes feel a bit shy in new environments, I always try to adapt and push myself to be more confident.

In my free time, I love reading books, playing piano, and also listening to music. I am also interested in visual art, because it allows me to express myself and continuously improve my skills.

My short-term goal is to finish my studies successfully while gaining as much experience as I can through projects and organizations. In the long term, I aspire to build a meaningful career in Geophysics and contribute positively to society.

To sum up, I would describe myself as someone who is eager to learn, open to new opportunities, and determined to achieve my goals. One of my favorite quotes is, ‚ÄúSuccess doesn‚Äôt come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what you do consistently.‚Äù
